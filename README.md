# Predicting Diabetes Risk from Health Indicators

This project uses the *Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset* (originally collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) to build machine learning models that predict whether an individual has diabetes based on demographic and lifestyle variables. The dataset contains over 200,000 survey responses and includes features such as Body Mass Index (BMI), physical activity, smoking status, age, and general health.  
The goal of this project is to use machine learning to identify the most important risk factors for diabetes and create a predictive model that can aid in early detection and prevention strategies.
